# E-commerce-Backend

## User Story 

As a developer, I want to build the backend of an e-commerce website for managers at internet retail companies. This backend will use the lastest technologies in order to be able to compete with other companies.


## Acceptance Criteria

When a person uses a functional Express.js API to add the database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file, they should be able to connect to the database using Sequelize. 

Then they enter schema and seed commands to be able to have a development database created and is seeded with test data.

When the user enters the command to invoke the application, the server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database.

After that, they will open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags. If done so successfully, the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.

Lastly, the user will have to test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core. And will hopefully be able to create, update, and delete data in my database.
